~~ NAMESPACES ~~

You can use namespaces as prefix. The prefixes should start with lower case.
Also, it is allowed to use an underscore after the namespace prefix. The only 
rule here is that you have to be consistent.

Example:

//	Without namespace
enum CarColors {
	Red,
	Blue,
	Green
}

//	With namespace
enum nwCarColors {
	Red,
	Blue,
	Green
}

//	With namespace (optional underscore separation)
enum nw_CarColors {
	Red,
	Blue,
	Green
}
